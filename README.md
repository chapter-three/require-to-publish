Require-to-publish
==================

A Drupal module which allows required fields to remain empty as long as the node is unpublished.

There is a D6 module which does this already: https://drupal.org/project/required_for_pub

Try to make compatible with Workbench, which handles status per revision rather than per node. Allow Workbench to set "require" level to an arbitrary state? (For instance, not required for "Draft" but required for "Needs Review" or "Published"?)
